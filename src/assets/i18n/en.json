      "DESCRIPCION": "Daiana is an advanced chatbot designed to connect and analyze a wide variety of resources, including documents in formats such as PDF, TXT, and JSON, as well as videos, audios, databases, and links to web pages and YouTube videos. Using artificial intelligence, Daiana learns the content of these resources to provide coherent and accurate responses when queried about them. Its ability to understand and process information from multiple sources makes it a powerful tool for knowledge extraction and assistance in various areas. Daiana can also create teams, each capable of storing multiple bots with different types of resources. It offers an enterprise view, allowing the owner to assign admins to each team. These admins can then appoint creators, who have the authority to create bots solely within their designated team. Additionally, Daiana enables users to specify permissions, determining who can view or access each created bot."
